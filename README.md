# ⚖️ UBUTABERA BWIHUSE (Fast Justice) – Phase I

### 📌 Overview
"Ubutabera Bwihuse", meaning Fast Justice, is a PL/SQL-based capstone project focused on helping the Rwandan justice system solve one major issue: delays in civil case resolutions, especially divorce cases.

While criminal cases in Rwanda are handled relatively fast, civil cases can take over a year (average 454 days) to conclude. These delays have real-life consequences like mental health issues, domestic violence, and increased crime. This project proposes a database system that uses Oracle PL/SQL to manage and analyze such cases more efficiently.
